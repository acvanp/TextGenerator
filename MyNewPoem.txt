jesus called find the
prices keep circling the
soul is the two
and human thing divorced
whether this was the
street as heads and
dark silent movie psst
someone with birds circling
the ganges is upon
us taken as far
off their colorings are
about sex is said
quot do and said
in its eyes ancient
sumerian queen is much
to me a bite
out to the mackenzie
churned livid curtain s
there was dancing on
restive serene in the
water beware the palest
halvah careless preparing sowing
the face which orpheus
liked my knees sputtering
endearments as dallas or
on the american scenes
of pebbles birds circle
of other hand i
am very much to
please i will not
look there is this
canal its white uniforms
and spits again lost
sight of holding on
all that holy nothing
